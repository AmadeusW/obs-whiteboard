# Whiteboard Cropper
_Share your whiteboard like a pro with your coworkers, students or followers.
Point your webcam at a whiteboard and don't worry about about aligning it!_

One of the best perks of working in the office was ability to brainstorm with coworkers on ubiquitous whiteboards. We wanted to retain this ability while working from home

This project is an OpenCV pipeline for detecting a whiteboard, aligning it and enhancing the image
